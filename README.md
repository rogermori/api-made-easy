A set of http request-and-response utilities commonly used in real life API development.

#### Run the tests
```

```


## Http Response

### StandardResponse
StandardResponse wraps all http-responses into successful http-responses. 
So, the caller-client decides the next step.

For example, upon receiving 400's or 500's http-response-codes, some frameworks will re send the request automatically again, 
or would timeout. StandardResponse would change this behavior.    

Including the original requests is help full in debug mode.
